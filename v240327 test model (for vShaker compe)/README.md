## intro

This is the test model info and materials for taster programmes held for young students to play with. N

Note that this is just for short gameplay (excluding the speech and talks, only 1 hour of actual gameplay) without extra preparation for the young participants. So the purpose is for fun for the youngsters therefor might not look so pretty made by the students. i would say the potential of this design is large lol.

The design is as modular as possible. You can easily adjust the parameters in the .f3d file. 




## vShaker compe

first off, this is the completed vShaker compe machine i made:

suggest using 4060 stepper motors or even more powerful ones if you are going to do heavy game play.

I tucked the whole electronic part under the shake table. Note that the temperature would be too high if you don't have enough cooling. 


a random build of a model with A4 paper as reinforcement on the shake table for preliminary test.

## How to print and make the model

For print parameters please check the .3mf file for reference. 

Suggest using PLA matt to print, which would be not too strong and not too weak, to achieve the game purpose.

Suggest using flat bed but not PEI plate for better consistency of the column beam elements. 

Suggest using cement paste for the casting of slabs with water cement ratio (w/c) between 0.3 to 0.4 for the balance of workability and strength. 

Suggest fixing the slab frame with texture tape and hot melt glue before casting. The below photo used using glass plate as the bottom plate, but lately i found that using thin wood plate or flexible plastic plate as the bottom would be much easier to compaction when casting and easier to demold.

If failed to vibrate enough after casting, the quality and appearance of the slabs might be bad:
