This is my current working version. 

Calling it a shake table is not actually so true, i'd rather say it is just a linear motion design or something like that. 





## BOM

To assemble one of this linear motion module, you will need the below stuff except for the printed parts: 

|Item No.	|Item Description								|Qty.	|
|---		|---											|---	|
|1			|2020 aluminum extrusion, 340 mm in my case.	|1		|
|2			|42 stepping motors, 4260/4248 in my cases.		|2		|
|3			|linear rail, MGN9h	with **TWO** sliders		|1		|
|4			|GT2 Open Belt 6 mm								|depend how long of your Item 1 is.	|
|5			|M3x8 BHCS										|~20	|
|6			|M5x10 BHCS										|8		|
|7			|M5 T-nut										|8		|

hope i didn't miss anything in the table...

**Figure 4** Push belt into printed carriage like this

You may need to try by yourself to estimate the length of belt you need. I believe you can do that without any tips. A bit longer or shorter won't be a problem since you can see there are huge margin left in the carriage.

**Figure 5** Use guiding tools to align the linear rail when install it onto 2020 extrusion

After installing the linear rail onto the 2020 extrusion, mount the 42 motor with printed casing by 4 M3x8 BHCS, then embed four of M5 T-nuts in the slots of 2020 extrusion and finish the installation of the motors at both ends of the extrusion. 

**Please be careful checkout the relative direction of carriage and motor casing. They should be like the below photo.**

**Figure 6** Installation of motor

And the pulley of course. Since i used printed 40 teeth pulley, M3 screw and M3 nut were needed in order to fasten the pulley on the shaft of motor. 

By now you should be able to confirm the length of belt you need. 



## Misc. 

Whatever you want to install on the carriage, it will be fixed by M3 screws. the length of those M3 screws will be decided by the stuff you load on the carriage. 

For example, i mounted 6 mm thick PMMA plate CNC with holes, M3x16 screws (if memory serves, sorry) were used. Those screws will directly screw into the sliders on linear rail.
