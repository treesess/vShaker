Except for the design of motion part, actually a whole shake table was made. However, due to the deadline of using it, it used too many weird parts and recycled materials, thus i don't think you really need the CAD for that. Perhaps later on i can make a more universal version of the whole shake table. 

By saying this, i simply want to express that it can work well (but just not ready for everyone to print yet). 

And i believe the provided CAD and STL is enough for you to build your shake table with your style of electronic compartment and a solid base.

**Figure 2** i think you don't want this weird electronic compartment and supporting legs

**Figure 3** and the back of skirt is rough... (and you really don't need that 500 W ACDC)

**Figure 4** anyway, i tried to make it look good

Yes, it's VORON style.

**Figure 5** After completion only one power supply cord is needed, yes, VORON part here

WIFI control is a must for this one. Only one button: the power on/off.

Basically this is the end of story. No photo taken for the lower part of skirt.
