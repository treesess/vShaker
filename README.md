## intro
This is a lightweight, low cost, educational demonstrative shaker table project with test models. 

The goal here is to use the basis of DIY 3D printer construction to make a simulation of ground seismic motion. Being a lover of FDM printers (especially Voron), this is my best idea to realize the function. 

All you need is some standard aluminum extrusions as frames, linear rails, M3 screw bolts and heat inserts for fastening, 2GT belts, stepper motors, pulleys, and an FDM printer to print the plastic parts. Yes since it is plastic-based, the potential must be great. Hope more people could join in the designing of test models and make the vibration visualized for the students and have fun for the enthusiasts. 

	• You may check on the Gallery and demo video here to see if this is something you do want. 
	• If you want it check on the BOM folder for the list of materials
	• You will need a 3D printer to print the parts in STL folder. I tried my best to make all parts easy to print. But be careful about tolerance. Check out the pdf for details. 
	• If you need further info, check out CAD folder for the original Fusion360 models. Forgive me I'm a not a skillful designer and the timeline may look a bit messy. 

I'd say again that I'm only an amateur doing mechanical design thus the design of the shaker/shaking table may have some issues. Hope some professionals could share an optimized design.
